Play with it live @ http://michaelpaulukonis.github.io/mispelr/

This is the node(-module) rewrite of [the web-based project](https://github.com/michaelpaulukonis/mispelr).

I'm not really sure why I wrote it web-based in the first place.

I wanted it online, but I could have written a module and wired it up.

Anyway.
